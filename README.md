# git-shotclock

This is a command designed to start drafting a Git commit, then make the commit after the files in the repository have settled for a pre-specified number of seconds (24, by default).

It was originally created for [my notes][notes], which are kept in a Git repository where I don't want intermediate states to get lost. It can also be useful for tracking work in a work-in-progress branch in a conventional project.
